# Business growth

> "My advice would be to spend less time on finance, spend less time in the conference rooms, less time on PowerPoint, and more time on just trying to make your product as amazing as possible." - Elon Musk

A developer asking questions about the value a product creates and the problems it solves or doesn't solve is the fastest way to making products as amazing as possible. When people understand the "why", they can contribute to the "what".

Successful companies differ from others by their norm of ownership, resulting in higher levels of autonomy, empowerment, and responsibility. This in turn opens up the possibility of using the scientific method - conducting experiments and analyzing data - enabling a far faster method of learning than that was earlier possible.

## Outcomes are the result of two-way negotiation

The focus of the team's efforts should be on the results they achieve, with an emphasis on the quality of these results rather than the volume of tasks completed.

Negotiating the desired outcomes should be a collaborative process between the product team and the company's product leadership (such as the Chief Product Officer or a Client Representative).

If you are being asked to deliver outputs with no regard for outcomes, ask your leader and stakeholders more questions to understand who you're building for and what the desired outcome is going to be.

If your team is setting their own outcome with no input from the product leader, ask your leader and stakeholders more questions to understand what the business is trying to achieve.

If your team is already negotiating outcomes with your product leader, congratulations!

## Define hypotheses

Hypothesis-driven development complements user stories by focusing on business outcomes instead of the user's goals.

> We believe *this capability* will result in *this outcome*. We will know we have succeeded when *we see a measurable signal*.

## Measure impact

It's impossible to contribute to business growth without a clear understanding of the impact your efforts have. Measuring impact involves setting up key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that directly correlate with the desired outcomes.

## Encourage innovation

Teams should have the freedom to experiment with multiple approaches to achieve better outcomes. This means that multiple solutions to the same problem are tried. This approach requires a supportive culture that views failures and setbacks not as final, but as valuable learning opportunities that contribute to the collective knowledge and improvement of the team.

Finding the best solution usually doesn't require multiple solutions to be coded. Instead, the emphasis should be on ideation, prototyping, and validation before committing significant resources to development.
