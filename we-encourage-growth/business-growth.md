# Business growth

When teams understand the business objectives of their work, it transforms the way they approach tasks. Instead of just following instructions, they can become proactive problem solvers.

When people understand the 'why', they can contribute to the 'what'. This means they can focus on finding the best way to solve a problem and ask questions like "Is there a better way to do this that we haven't considered?" or "Does this feature genuinely serve our end goal?".

Furthermore, the freedom to experiment is an invaluable asset. Traditional development models can sometimes handcuff developers to specific paths, but when the focus is the objective, there's room to explore. Experimentation leads to innovation. It means teams can test out different approaches, determine what works best, and pivot when necessary. When teams can rapidly iterate and pivot based on feedback, products and features are released faster, granting the company a competitive edge.

## Outcomes are the result of two-way negotiation

The focus of the team's efforts should be on the results they achieve, with an emphasis on the quality of these results rather than the volume of tasks completed.

Negotiating the desired outcomes should be a collaborative process between the product team and the company's product leadership (such as the Chief Product Officer or a Client Representative).

If you are being asked to deliver outputs with no regard for outcomes, ask your leader and stakeholders more questions to understand who you're building for and what the desired outcome is going to be.

If your team is setting their own outcome with no input from the product leader, ask your leader and stakeholders more questions to understand what the business is trying to achieve.

If your team is already negotiating outcomes with your product leader, congratulations!

## Define hypotheses

Hypothesis-driven development complements user stories by focusing on business outcomes instead of the user's goals.

> We believe *this capability* will result in *this outcome*. We will know we have succeeded when *we see a measurable signal*.

## Measure impact

It's impossible to contribute to business growth without a clear understanding of the impact your efforts have. Measuring impact involves setting up key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that directly correlate with the desired outcomes.

## Encourage innovation

Teams should have the freedom to experiment with multiple approaches to achieve better outcomes. This means that multiple solutions to the same problem are tried. This approach requires a supportive culture that views failures and setbacks not as final, but as valuable learning opportunities that contribute to the collective knowledge and improvement of the team.

Finding the best solution usually doesn't require multiple solutions to be coded. Instead, the emphasis should be on ideation, prototyping, and validation before committing significant resources to development.
