# Customer feedback

> *Customer centricity is the ability of people in an organization to understand customers' situations, perceptions, and expectations.*

## Why

Software being deployed without understanding how it's used is a familiar tragedy in today's business. Brilliant teams can release innovative products, but without insight from the world outside, these products often fall flat.

It's a common misconception that product teams should operate in silos, with each group focusing solely on their specific roleâ€”coding for engineers, strategizing for product managers, and designing for designers. This approach does not lead to the best results. All product team members including developers must be exposed to the consequences of their creations - both the good and the bad.

- **Increased customer satisfaction:** By focusing on the needs and feedback of customers, companies can create products that accurately meet user expectations, leading to higher satisfaction rates. Satisfied customers are more likely to become repeat customers and brand advocates.
- **Faster feedback loops:** Developers armed with real-time feedback can quickly iterate on their solutions, reducing the time between product releases and improvements, and speeding up time-to-market.
- **Increased revenue and market share:** According to research carried out by Deloitte, customer-centric companies are 60% more profitable than those not focused on the customer.
- **Reduced risk of product failure:** By involving customers in the development process, companies can validate their concepts and assumptions before investing heavily in production. This iterative approach can significantly reduce the risk of product failure.
