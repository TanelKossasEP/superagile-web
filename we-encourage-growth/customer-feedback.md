# Customer feedback

> *Customer centricity is the ability of people in an organization to understand customers' situations, perceptions, and expectations.*

## Why

Software being deployed without understanding how it's used is a familiar tragedy in today's business. Brilliant teams can release innovative products, but without leveraging insights from the world outside, these products often fail to resonate with their target audience.

- **Increased customer satisfaction:** By focusing on the needs and feedback of customers, companies can create products that accurately meet user expectations, leading to higher satisfaction rates. Satisfied customers are more likely to become repeat customers and brand advocates.
- **Faster feedback loops:** Developers armed with real-time feedback can quickly iterate on their solutions, reducing the time between product releases and improvements, and speeding up time-to-market.
- **Increased revenue and market share:** According to research carried out by Deloitte, customer-centric companies are 60% more profitable than those not focused on the customer.
- **Reduced risk of product failure:** By involving customers in the development process, companies can validate their concepts and assumptions before investing heavily in production. This iterative approach can significantly reduce the risk of product failure.

## How

### Start talking to customers

At the very least, product teams should talk to customers once a week.

[The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/) is the best short book on how to talk to customers to find opportunities and learn if your ideas are good.

### Use product analytics

Integrate with a product analytics platform like MixPanel, Amplitude, or PostHog to enable your team to continuously analyze user behaviors.

Nowadays, it's also possible to use tools like Sentry and Hotjar to record user sessions, so you can review video-like reproductions of real users' sessions

### Do usability testing

Usability testing is a research method used to evaluate a product or service by testing it with representative users. This process involves observing users as they attempt to complete tasks on the product or service being tested. The primary goal is to identify any usability problems, gather qualitative and quantitative data, and gauge the participant's satisfaction with the product.

### Make Customer Feedback available to all team members

Customer-centrism should not be limited to product managers and designers. All product team members including developers must be exposed to the consequences of their creations - both the good and the bad.

Customer feedback not being available to all team members slows down iteration speed, because it increases the communication overhead of each change. Separation also limits the flow of ideas and creative solutions, hindering innovation and the development of well-rounded, user-centric products.
