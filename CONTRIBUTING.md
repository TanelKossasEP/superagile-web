## Updating the Playbook: Who Can Contribute?

We welcome contributions from everyone, not just Concise employees. If you've spotted something that needs updating or fixing, feel free to submit your changes.

## Contribution Process

Editing a page usually involves adding, removing, or modifying content.  

All changes are made through GitHub, where our files are hosted. We use Markdown for formatting. If you're new to Markdown, check out [this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for guidance. Don't stress about perfect formatting; it can be refined during review.

Submit your edits as a pull request (PR). You'll be notified of any feedback or comments. You can then choose to incorporate the suggestions or discuss them further with the reviewer.

Once your PR is approved and merged, the changes will be published. If you have additional edits, simply repeat the process.

## How to Make Edits within GitHub

1. Visit the [repository](https://github.com/concise-ee/superagile-web).
2. Locate the file by navigating through the directories. You can see the file's location in the URL of the web page. For example, if you are on [https://superagile.app/**we-get-things-done/continuous_deployment.html**](https://superagile.app/we-get-things-done/continuous_deployment.html). The file is located at */we-get-things-done/continuous_deployment.md*.
3. Click **Edit this file** at the top corner of the file page. If it says **Edit this file in your fork of this project**, the process is identical, but indicates you're editing within a forked repository.
   - For Markdown tips, refer to the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
4. Make your changes and commit them to initiate a pull request.
5. Provide a clear title and a summary of your edits if the default title isn't descriptive enough.
6. By default, you'll **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. You can customize the branch name or leave it as is.
7. Click **Propose changes**.
8. Review your changes on the next page, ensuring everything is correct.
9. Confirm the details and click **Create pull request** once you're satisfied with your edits.
