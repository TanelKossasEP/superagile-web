## Updating the Playbook: Who Can Contribute?

We welcome contributions from everyone, not just Concise employees. If you've spotted something that needs updating or fixing, feel free to submit your changes.

## Contribution Process

All changes are made as pull requests (PR) through the GitHub [superagile-web repo](https://github.com/concise-ee/superagile-web/), where our files are hosted.

## How to edit using GitHub web interface

Make sure you are logged in to GitHub before starting.

1. Open the page you would like to edit on superagile.app.
2. Click *edit this page on github* link at the bottom of the page.
3. Make your changes. Don't be stressed about formatting or perfection, everything can be changed during review.
4. Create a pull request. If you need a bit of hand-holding, check out GitHub Docs for [Editing Files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).
